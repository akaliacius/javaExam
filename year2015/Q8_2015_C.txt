What is an interface type in Java? Explain the difference between a class and interface type

An interface in the Java programming language is an abstract type that is used to specify a behaviour that classes must implement. 

Interfaces are declared using the 'interface' keyword, and may only contain method signature and constant declarations (variable declarations that are declared to be both static and final). 

All methods of an Interface do not contain implementation (method bodies) as of all versions below Java 8. 

Starting with Java 8, default and static methods may have implementation in the interface definition.

Interfaces cannot be instantiated, but rather are implemented. A class that implements an interface must implement all of the methods described in the interface, or be an abstract class. 

Object references in Java may be specified to be of an interface type; in each case, they must either be null, or be bound to an object that implements the interface.
